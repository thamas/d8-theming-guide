Since this text is constantly in progress. This means it still contains some typos and spelling mistakes.

## Example theme code

Recently, I added some example code in the repo to get you started. The example (awesome) theme can be found in the `src` folder. Have fun with it. Happy Drupal 8 theming. 

> Get Twiggy with it!

## Introduction

Drupal 8 is going to be a huge change for the entire community. In order to get front-end developers ready for Drupal 8, I created this theming guide. It contains an overview of how you can build a Drupal 8 theme, using modern front-end tools. If you find any mistakes or outdated documentation, feel free to add a pull request.

## Some major changes

Let's kick of with some major changes that you, as a Drupal themer, must be aware of. This is especially useful if you've been involved in Drupal 7 theming in the past.

- The markup in Drupal 8 is now [HTML5](http://buytaert.net/html5-in-drupal-8). New tags like `header`, `nav`, `article` are used in core. 

- [WAI-ARIA Roles](https://www.drupal.org/node/1179668) are added. They are a set of roles, states, and properties, which can be applied to markup to provide rich semantics, increasing accessibility and interoperability. Although WAI-ARIA properties were not valid in xhtml 1.0, they are valid in HTML5, and can therefore be applied in the markup of Drupal 8. By using the role attribute with an HTML element, authors can provide more information about the purpose of components on the page.

- `<DIV ID="BAD-PRACTICE">...</DIV>`. Drupal 8 now has 75% less ID's than the Drupal 7 CSS! In other words: **kill all the #ids**!

- [The CSS (File) Structure](https://www.drupal.org/node/1887918) is based on SMACSS & BEM.

- [Drupal is now of the box responsive and mobile ready.](https://groups.drupal.org/mobile/drupal-8)

- [The default settings and config are changed to be fast and safe production values.](https://www.drupal.org/node/2259531)
This is important because in a default Drupal 8 installation, CSS and JS aggregation is enabled. On your local development environment, you "might" want to disable this. 

- [A completely new theme/template system: Twig](https://www.drupal.org/node/1831138)
Twig is a completely new theme/template system. This means the `theme_*` functions and PHP-based `*.tpl.php` files have been completely replaced in D8.

- [Drupal 8 does not support browsers that do not support SVG](https://www.drupal.org/node/2298227)
Drupal 8 uses SVG in place of PNG to provide resolution independent icons in the admin UI. No effort is made to cater for browsers that do not support SVG. This includes IE8 and below and Android Browser 2.3 and below.

- Due to the fact that these older browsers are no longer supported, the css in Drupal core is able to move a big step forward. Instead of adding classes like odd, even, first and last; we are now able to use pseudo selectors. [Most first/last/odd/even classes removed in favor of CSS3 pseudo selectors](https://www.drupal.org/node/2178215)

- [An new, empty core theme](https://www.drupal.org/node/2289511)
Read more on *classy*, a new core theme below. 

- [CSS classes being moved from preprocess to Twig templates](https://www.drupal.org/node/2325067).

## Drupal core themes

Drupal **core** themes live inside `core/themes`. Inside this folder we can find the four Drupal 8 core themes:

- **bartik**: *A flexible, recolorable theme with many regions and a responsive, mobile-first layout.*
- **seven**: *The default administration theme for Drupal 8 was designed with clean lines, simple blocks, and sans-serif font to emphasize the tools and tasks at hand.*
- **stark**: *An intentionally plain theme with almost no styling to demonstrate default Drupal’s HTML and CSS.*

You might remember these three themes from Drupal 7. But wait, there's more ...

- **classy**: [[meta] Results of Drupalcon Austin's Consensus Banana](https://www.drupal.org/node/2289511): At DrupalCon Austin (2014) the need for a new core theme came up.

![An overview of the core themes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/theme-overview.png)

### Bartik

*Bartik* was introduced in Drupal 7 as a new, clean and simple theme. The theme has some new cool features in Drupal 8 and is also completely responsive. 

![Bartik screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/bartik.png)

### Seven

*Seven* was also introduced in Drupal 7. It is the default administrative theme. The theme was created to improve the Drupal 7 user experience. For Drupal 8, [a style guide for Seven](https://groups.drupal.org/node/283223) was introduced to improve this experience even more and give it a refreshing look.

> Some people might be wondering if this theme should be renamed to `eight`? The answer is **no**.

![Seven screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/seven.png)

### Stark

*Stark* is core theme that demonstrates Drupal's default markup. It does not contain any template files, so it outputs the layout that come straight out of other (core) modules. This is of course very useful for a developer:
- you can code against Stark when writing CSS for modules
- as a theme developer, you can check against Stark, to see if a layout issue comes from the theme or another module.

![Stark screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/stark.png)

### Classy

At DrupalCon Austin (2014) the need for a new core theme came up. Here's a brief overview of the meta issue:

> *Create a new core theme (code name "classy") that contains a copy of the all current core template files; this is for the "sensible 2/3" camp. And then modify all of the core/modules template files to contain minimal classes (only those needed for functionality); this would be for the "clean 1/3" camp. To ensure that Seven and Bartik continue to function properly, they should use "classy" as their base theme.*

Classy will be a `base theme` which *Bartik* and *Seven* will extend from.

[Add classy.info.yml to core, set Classy as base theme for Bartik and Seven](https://www.drupal.org/node/2329501)

At DrupalCon Amsterdam, the **classy.info.yml** got commited into Drupal 8 core by Dries. The change record can be found [here](https://www.drupal.org/node/2337467).

### Coding standards

It's important to know and follow the Drupal coding standards, especially when you want to get involved into Drupal core (theme) development. Yet, it's might be useful as well to follow these standards in your own projects.

There are coding standards for css, javascript and the new Twig template engine:

- [CSS Coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/node/1886770).
- [Javascript Coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/node/172169).
- [Twig Coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/node/1823416).

#### SMACSS

Drupal 8 uses the **SMACSS** system to conceptually categorize CSS rules.

1. Base
2. Layout
3. Component (The official **SMACSS** theminoly for this is *modules*. Since *modules* have a different meaning in Drupal, this component was rename to component, to avoid confusion.)
4. State
5. Theme

#### BEM

BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a naming convention.

`.block__element--modifier`

- A **block** is an independent entity with its own meaning that represents a piece of interface on a page.
- An **element** is a part of a block, tied to it semantically and functionally. It has no meaning outside of the block it belongs to. Not all blocks have elements.
- **Modifiers** are flags set on blocks or elements; they define properties or states. They may be boolean (for example, visible: true or false) or key-value pairs (size: large, medium, small) — somewhat similar to HTML attributes, but not exactly the same. Multiple modifiers are allowed on a single item if they represent different properties.

## Theme engines

Inside the `core/themes` lives a fourth folder (besides `bartik`, `seven` and `stark`), called `engines`. This folder contains the theme engines. In Drupal 8, the default template engine is **Twig**. The default template engine from Drupal 7, PHPTemplate, does still exist. Although it's not recommended to continue using the engine, it might be useful when you're migrating your Drupal 7 site to Drupal 8. 

### What is a theme engine?

A theme engines (template engine, template processor or template parser) is a software components that **combines data with templates** from themes and shows the result - the final HTML - to the user.

![Template Engine image from Wikipedia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/TempEngGen015.svg/440px-TempEngGen015.svg.png)

### Twig

Twig is a modern template engine for PHP. All of the `theme_*` functions and PHPTemplate based `*.tpl.php` files have been completely replace in Drupal 8 by Twig template files. The template files now have a new (Twig) extension, `*.html.twig`.

[This is the official change record](https://www.drupal.org/node/1831138).

#### Advantages

- Twig is more secure, due to the fact that only a number of tags can be used. In the previous PHPTemplate, it was possible for a template file to execute the following code:

		<?php
		  db_query('DROP TABLE {users}');
		?>
	
  This should of course not be the case. In case you're wondering what it does: it removes the entire `users` table from your database. Not good, right?

- There now is a clear separation between the *logic* and the *view*. This means: no more PHP code inside your template files. 
- The syntax is very easy to understand, making the code more readable as well. Also, many IDE's have syntax highlighting for `*.twig` files.
- Template files are reusable, thanks to [Twig includes](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/tags/include.html).
- Debugging is much more easy. First of all, Twig outputs a helpful message with the filename and the line number whenever there is a syntax problem within a template. Secondly, you can turn on a Twig debug function. More on that later. 
- Twig is very well documented. Go ahead and [start reading the official documentation here](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation).
- It's not only used in Drupal core, so it's no a Drupaly-thing.

#### Disadvantage

- Although the syntax is very easy to read and understand, it's a new syntax you have to learn before getting started.


## Getting started with Twig

A quick tutorial to get started with Twig template files.

### Twig autoescape enabled

[Twig autoescape enabled](https://www.drupal.org/node/2296163) by default. This means that every string printed from a Twig template (anything between `{{ }}`) gets escaped.

> Escape a string means to reduce ambiguity characters in a string. 

### Printing a variable

To print a simple variable in a template, use `{{ variable }}`. It's possible to let the varible go through a filter before printing it. This can be done using `{{ varible|filter }}`. 

#### Twig filters

- `|length`, returns the number of items of a sequence or mapping, or the length of a string.
- `|lower`, converts a value to lowercase.
- `|upper`, converts a value to uppercase.
- …

A complete list of default Twig filters [can be found here](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/filters/index.html).

#### Drupal filters

Drupal has added some extra filters available to use in a template.

##### Translation filters

- `t` will run the variable through the Drupal `t()` function, which will return a translated string. An example:
`<a href="{{ url('<front>') }}" title="{{ 'Home'|t }}" rel="home" class="site-logo"></a>`

- `passthrough` 
- `placeholder`

To safely escape all of the Twig variables detected in a {% trans %} tag, the variables are sent with an `@` prefix by default. To pass-through a variable (**!**) or use as a placeholder (**%**), the `passthrough` or `placeholder` filters are used.

- **passthrough** gets no sanitization or formatting and should only be used for text that has already been prepared for HTML display.
- **placeholder** gets escaped to HTML and formatted using [drupal_placeholder()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21includes%21bootstrap.inc/function/drupal_placeholder/8), which makes it display as <em>emphasized</em> text.

##### Replace twig's escape filter with our own.

- `drupal_escape` is a replacement function for Twig's escape filter. See [twig_drupal_escape_filter](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21themes%21engines%21twig%21twig.engine/function/twig_drupal_escape_filter/8)

##### Implements safe joining.

- `safe_join` to safely joins several strings together. See [twig_drupal_join_filter](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21themes%21engines%21twig%21twig.engine/function/twig_drupal_join_filter/8)

##### Array filters

- `without` creates a copy of the renderable array and removes child elements by key specified through filter's arguments. The copy can be printed without these elements. The original renderable array is still available and can be used to print child elements in their entirety in the twig template.

##### CSS class and ID filters.

- `clean_class` 
- `clean_id`

#### Translations

The Twig i18n extension allows marking parts of a template as translatable. Let's start of with an easy example:

	`{%trans %} Hello world {% endtrans %}`

It's possible to embed a variable in a translatable string, using the `{{ variable }}` syntax.

	`{%trans %} Hello {{ name }} {% endtrans %}`

To apply a filter to a variable, used in a translatable block you first need to assign the result to a variable.

	{% set name = name|capitalize %}

	{% trans %}
    	  Hello {{ name }}!
	{% endtrans %}

A translatable string can be pluralized. Implementing a `{% plural ... %}` switch makes this possible.

	{% trans %}
	  Hello star.
	{% plural count %}
	  Hello {{ count }} stars.
	{% endtrans %}

[@todo:] {% trans %} debugging

#### Comments

`{# Comments go inside these brackets. #}`

#### Functions

An `if` function.

	{% if site_slogan %}
	  <div class="site-slogan">{{ site_slogan }}</div>
	{% endif %}

A `for` function. The output for this is `0, 1, 2, 3`.

> The `range` function returns a list containing an arithmetic progression of integers.

	{% for i in range(0, 3) %}
	  {{ i }},
	{% endfor %}

Another example, from the `field--node--title.html.twig` template:

	{%- for item in items -%}
	  {{ item.content }}
	{%- endfor -%}

#### Create a Twig variable

Sometimes it might be useful to define variables in a template file. `{% set foo=“bar” %}` declaires a variable `foo` and assigns the value `bar` to it. Later in the template, the variable can be printed out using `{{ foo }}`. 

## The themes directory

All right. Now is the time to get really excited. We're about to create a Drupal 8 theme! The question that raises is: where should this theme be located, where should I put the files?

> If you're familiar with Drupal 7 theming, the first place for you to look at would be `drupal/sites/all/themes/{custom/}` (the place where all your custom themes lived in Drupal 7).

In Drupal 8, this location has changed. Custom and contrib themes now live in `drupal/themes`. Also notice that (custom and contrib) modules now live inside `drupal/modules` (instead of drupal/sites/all/modules/).

> Did you notice {*custom*}? It's always a good practice to separate the contrib themes (the one's you've been downloading from d.o) and the ones you've written yourself. This can simply be done by creating two folders inside the `themes` directory:

> `contrib`: for contrib themes  
> `custom`: for custom themes

### Create your custom theme directory

Let's create an `example` directory inside `themes/custom`, resulting in `themes/custom/example`. Inside this directory, all the code for our custom theme will live.

## Classy

When creating your theme, you have two possibilities. You can create a theme…

1. using **Classy** as base theme. This will result in some default classes and markup in your template files (since the template files from **Classy** will be used). Of course, you can still override these template files with your own. 
2. without **Classy** as base theme. No default markup and classes will be added to the template files. This way, you have full control of all the markup and classes. **This is the default option!**

In the following example, we have two custom themes. The first theme, *Awesome*, uses **Classy** as a base theme. The second theme, *Kitten*, doesn't use **Classy** as a base theme.

> In order to extend from **Classy** in a custom theme, check the documention below (# Using a base theme).

![Awesome and Kitten theme examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/custom-theme.png)

## Creating an info file

### A simple .info.yml file

Again, if you're familiar with Drupal 7 theming, your first idea might be to start with creating an `.info` file. In Drupal 8, `.info` files are replaced by `.info.yml` files ([read the change record](https://www.drupal.org/node/1935708)). These files are parsed using the Symphony YAML Component. This change also applies for modules and installation profiles. They both require a `.info.yml` now, instead of the old `.info` file. Once you've created the file, it's time to add the write the first line of code.

	name: Awesome Theme
	
Fairly simple. This is the name of the theme. It's the name that also appears on the *Appearance* page, where you can activate your theme.
	
	description: 'An awesome D8 theme.'

A theme description. This description is also displayed on the *Appearance* page.

	package: Custom
	
The package in which your theme lives. For the core themes, this package is of course `core`.
	
	type: theme

Since the `info.yml` files are used for besides themes also used for modules and profiles, this line lets Drupal know if it's a theme, module or a profile.
	
	version: 1.0

The version of the theme. 	
	
	core: 8.x
	
The version of Drupal core the theme requires.

#### Using a base theme

	base theme: classy

The line above gives you the power to extend from a base theme. This line can be found in both `bartik.info.yml` and  `seven.info.yml`, since these two core themes extend **Classy**.

#### *.info.yml

To wrap things up, this is our `.info.yml` file so far:

	name: Awesome Theme
	description: 'An awesome D8 theme.'
	base theme: classy
	package: Custom
	type: theme
	version: 1.0
	core: 8.x
	
Save this as `{theme_name}.info.yml` (`awesome.info.yml`) inside the created custom theme directory (eg. `themes/custom/example/example.info.yml`). Now navigate to `admin/appearance` and see your theme displayed. You can now even enable the theme. Hooray!
  		    
#### Adding a screenshot

When navigation to the appearance page, you might notice a *no screenshot* image for our theme. This is because no screenshot has been found (duh!). A screenshot is automatically detected and displayed if the filename is `screenshot.png`. If we add this file, we would see the screenshot on the appearance page.

Otherwise you can manually add a screenshot with the following line:

	screenshot: otherfilename.png
	
If everything went well, you should be able to see the screenshot:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/awesome_theme_screenshot.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqndr/d8-theming-guide/master/img/awesome_theme_screenshot.png)
	
Conclusion: the filename for a screenshot does not have to be `screenshot.png`, as long as it is defined in the *{theme}.info.yml* file.

#### Adding stylesheets

It's of course important to know how to add stylesheets to your theme. Let's add a css file called `styles.css` (that lives inside the `css` directory: `/css/styles.css`) to our theme.

	# Adding styles.css to our theme.
	stylesheets:
	  all:
	    - css/styles.css
	
> In Drupal 7, this could be achieved by adding the following line:  
	
	stylesheets[all][] = css/style.css

The css file is now added. The `all` keyword stands for the media tag inside the html `link` element that is used to add stylesheets:

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="[stylesheet]" media="all" />
	
So ... now that you know this, it's very easy to add a print stylesheet to our theme as well:

	# Adding a print stylesheet to our theme.
	stylesheets:
	  print:
 	    - css/print.css

Inside the html:

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="[stylesheet]" media="print" />
	
#### Overriding stylesheets

In Drupal 8, drupal.base.css has been replaced with normalize.css ([see this change record](https://www.drupal.org/node/2168417)). If you want to include a different version of normalize.css, you can override this file.

	# Remove a CSS file:​
	stylesheets-override:
	  - normalize.css
 
#### Removing stylesheets

Alternatively, we can also completely remove a css file.

	# Remove a CSS file:​
	stylesheets-remove:
	  - normalize.css     	
 	
#### Regions

Regions can be defined using the `regions` tag. Here is an example where 3 regions are defined: a *header*, a *content* and a *footer* region:

	# Regions
	regions:
	  header: 'Header'
	  content: 'Content'
	  footer: 'Footer'
	
#### Regions hidden

The `regions_hidden` can be applied to any previous defined *regions*. Regions with this attribute will not show up on the block administration page. This means they can't have blocks assigned to them by ordinary mechanisms. For example, Drupal uses this feature to protect the special 'page_top' and 'page_bottom' regions from adventurous themers. This can be used by module writers and theme writers to protect a given region from having unexpected content inserted into the output. The `seven.info.yml` contains this tag, in order to *hide* the 'Sidebar First' region.

	regions_hidden:
  	  - sidebar_first
  	  
## Javascript

### Libraries and Scripts

Drupal 8 doesn't load any additional scripts. This also means that by default a library like [jQuery is not included](https://www.drupal.org/node/1541860). You have to declare it as a dependency for your script in order to use it. In the early stages of Drupal 8, this was done using `hook_library_info`. Since this was one of the last remaining hooks in Drupal 8, it got [replaced by a `*.libraries.yml` file](https://www.drupal.org/node/2201089).

> Since Drupal 8 does not support IE8 and below, and because Javacript has evolved, [you might not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/). If hovever you do want to use jQuery, make sure to look up some of the [best practices](http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/jquery-standards/) for using jQuery.

Let's add some custom javascript to our theme. Our script will location in the `js` folder inside our theme (`/js/awesome.js`). Next, we create a `*.libraries.yml` file. Let's call this `awesome.libraries.yml` (`{theme-or-module-name}`.libraries.yml) and save it into the root of our theme. 
	
	base:
	  version: 1.x
	  js:
	    js/awesome.js: {}
	  dependencies:
	    - core/drupal
	    - core/jquery
	    - core/jquery.once

> We need `core/drupal` in order to take advantage of the `Drupal.behaviors`. To include the Drupal core version of jQuery, we add `core/jquery`. The final dependency is `core/jquery.once`, a jQuery plugin allowing to only apply a function once to an element.
	    
Back in our `awesome.info.yml` file, we now add the following lines, to include the new declared *library* into our theme.

	libraries:
	  - awesome/base

This includes our the custom javascript and the dependencies into our theme. In this example, both the custom script and the jQuery library are now included in our theme.

`Drupal.behaviors` are still part of javascript in core. Let's open the `awesome.js` and add a little behavior.

	(function ($) {
  	  "use strict"
  	  Drupal.behaviors.awesome = {
            attach: function (context, settings) {
              $('main').once('awesome').append('<p>Hello world</p>');
            }
  	  };
	}(jQuery));
	
Let's have a quick look at what this does.
	
The behavior has to have a unique namespace. In the example the namespace is `awesome` (`Drupal.behaviors.awesome`). The `context` variable is the part of the page for which this applies. This is especially useful when working with AJAX.  The `settings` variable is used to pass information from the PHP code to the javascript. Next is some custom code that creates a `p`aragraph-tag, with the text *Hello world*, and appends it to the `main`-tag. Using the `.once('awesome')` will make sure the code only runs once. It adds a `processed`- class to the `main` tag (`<main role="main" class="awesome-processed">`) in order to accomplish this.

Some libraries both have javascript (js) and stylesheets (css). It's possible to include these stylesheets as well. As an example, here's how to include [Picker](http://formstone.it/components/picker) (version 3.1.0) into the `awesome` theme. Most of the parameters are the same, but this time we add a `remote` and `css` tag. Using the `remote` parameter, allows you to define an external link to the library. The `css` tag will include the css file from the library. The level underneath, `theme` is necessary due to the `SMACSS` standard; used for CSS file organisation. 

	picker:
	  version: 3.1.0
	  remote: http://formstone.it/components/picker
	  js:
	    lib/picker/js/jquery.fs.picker.js: {}
	  css:
	    theme:
	      lib/picker/css/jquery.fs.picker.css: {}
	  dependencies:
	    - core/jquery

### File-closure

All of the javascript code **must** be declared inside a closure wrapping the whole file. This closure **must** be in strict mode. 

	(function () {
  	  "use strict";
  	  // Custom javascript

### "use strict"

The `"use strict"` directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 and ignored by previous versions of javascript. The purpose of `"use strict"` is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". As an example, in *scrict mode*, you cannot use undeclared variables.

### ESHint

> As of Drupal 8, we use ESLint to make sure our JavaScript code is consistent and free from syntax error and leaking variables and that it can be properly minified.

[More on ESLint](https://www.drupal.org/node/1955232)

## Breakpoints

> The Breakpoint module keeps track of the height, width, and resolution breakpoints where a responsive design needs to change in order to respond to different devices being used to view the site. **This module does not have a user interface**, but contributed modules such as [Breakpoint UI](http://drupal.org/project/breakpoint_ui) may provide one.

Both themes and modules can define breakpoints by creating a configuration file called `{name}.breakpoints.yml` where `{name}` is the name of your theme or module. 


To get a good example, let look at `bartik.breakpoints.yml`:

	bartik.mobile:
	  label: mobile
	  mediaQuery: '(min-width: 0px)'
	  weight: 0
	  multipliers:
	    - 1x
	bartik.narrow:
	  label: narrow
	  mediaQuery: 'all and (min-width: 560px) and (max-width: 850px)'
	  weight: 1
	  multipliers:
	    - 1x
	bartik.wide:
	  label: wide
	  mediaQuery: 'all and (min-width: 851px)'
	  weight: 2
	  multipliers:
	    - 1x 

For more information, see the [online documentation for the Breakpoint module](https://drupal.org/documentation/modules/breakpoint).

## Theme functions

This section is dedicated to all people who have been dealing with `theme`-functions in Drupal 7. All of the `theme`-function are gone and have been replaced with template files. The next section goes into detail about how you can modify and override them. It also handles how you can complety control all the classes add to the layout.

> As you're reading this, it might be possible that some of the theme_ functions still exists. The goal would be to have all of them removed completly by a first release canditate.

## Template files (Twig)

Twig is a PHP-based compiled templating language. When your web page renders, the Twig engine takes the template and converts it into a 'compiled' PHP template which it stores in a protected directory in sites/default/files/php_storage/... The compilation is done once. Template files are cached for reuse and are recompiled on clearing the Twig cache.

### /templates folder

The `theme`-functions are gone. Almost all the core themes (and modules) now contain a new folder called `templates`. In this folder, the Twig template files are stored.

[@todo:] Document the new folder, that contains all the templates files instead of all the `theme_`-functions. 

### Twig debug

An **awesome** new feature from the Twig engine is the debug tool. It allows you to trace where the template comes from. To enable Twig Debugging, all you have to do is set the `debug` variable in the `twig.config ` to `true`. Navigate to `sites/default/services.yml` to change the it:

	parameters:
	  twig.config:
	  debug: false
